# Welcome to Kyran Ford's Personal Portfolio Website Repository! :wave:

This repository holds the codebase for my personal portfolio website, which I've designed as an interactive main menu. This innovative approach ensures a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to access various sections with ease and without excessive scrolling. As soon as a link is clicked, the requested information animates onto the page, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience. Dive into the repository to explore how it all comes together!

## Tech Stack :computer:

The website has been carefully constructed using core web technologies:

- **HTML5** - Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3** - Employed for styling and layout, contributing to the website's aesthetic appeal.
- **JavaScript** - Utilized to create interactive elements, implement the main menu navigation system, and drive the engaging animations.

These tools combined allowed me to develop a user-friendly, animated, and responsive portfolio that truly reflects my skills and projects.

## Main Features :star:

- **Interactive Main Menu** - This central feature provides a user-friendly navigation system, enabling easy access to all sections with minimal scrolling and a dynamic, animated transition.
- **Home Section** - A welcoming introduction and a brief about me.
- **Projects Section** - A display of my tech projects with corresponding GitHub repository links.
